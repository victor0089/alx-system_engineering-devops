# Mysql

This project involved learning how to configure database servers in a
primary-replica model. I configured the two servers provided to me by
ALX in a MySQL primary-replica setup with a dummy database, and wrote
a Bash script to automate generation of database backups.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* [4-mysql_configuration_primary](./4-mysql_configuration_primary): The MySQL
`my.conf` configuration file used to set up my first server as a primary database
server on the database `tyrell_corp`.

* [4-mysql_configuration_replica](./4-mysql_configuration_replica): The MySQL
`my.conf` configuration file used to set up my second server as the replica
database server on the database `tyrell_corp`.

* [5-mysql_backup](./5-mysql_backup): Bash script that generates a compressed
`tar.gz` archive from a MySQL dump.
  * Usage: `./5-mysql_backup <MySQL root password>`
  * Generates a dump containing all MySQL databases on the root server.
  * Names the resulting tar archive in the format `day-month-year.tar.gz`.
