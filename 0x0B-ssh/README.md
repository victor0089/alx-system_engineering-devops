# SSH

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working
with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server
provided by ALX.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Use a private key**
  * [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to my
Holberton-provided server.

* **1. Create an SSH key pair**
  * [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

* **2. Client configuration file**
  * [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config): SSH configuration file configured to use the private key
`~/.ssh/holberton` and to refuse authentication using a password.
